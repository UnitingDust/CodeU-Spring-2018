      <h1>About the CodeU Chat App</h1>
      <p>
        This chat app was created by CodeU Team 32 to make connecting with friends and family more fun!!

       <li><strong> Lets meet the team: </strong></li>

        <li>Jessica: from Princeton New Jersey, originally grew up in Edison, New Jersey. She hopes to really get technical experience working with the team and learn from everyone's ideas, thought processes, and problem-solving methods. </li>

       <li> Isabella: from State College, Pennsylvania, is originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is excited to have the opportunity to strengthen my programming, problem solving, and creativity skills and meet new people with a similar passion to herself. </li>

        <li>Angel Chen: from Bethlehem,(but actually from Philadelphia, PA) hopes to discover what it is like to work on a big project with other people and to improve skills as a Software Developer in general. </li>

        <li>Johanna: from South Hadley, Massachusetts is originally from Jamaica and currently live in Miami and goes to school in Western Massachusetts. In this CodeU program, she hopes to gain technical experience, discover what its like to like to collaborate on a big project, improve her software developing skills, meet new people, and just overall learn new things </li>


              </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algorithms and data structures:</strong> We've made the app
            and the code as simple as possible. You will have to extend the
            existing data structures to support your enhancements to the app,
            and also make changes for performance and scalability as your app
            increases in complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Look and feel:</strong> The focus of CodeU is on the Java
          side of things, but if you're particularly interested you might use
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the chat app prettier.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Think about a group you care about.
          What needs do they have? How could you help? Think about technical
          requirements, privacy concerns, and accessibility and
          internationalization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is your code now. Get familiar with it and get comfortable
        working with your team to plan and make changes. Start by updating the
        homepage and this about page to tell your users more about your team.
        This page should also be used to describe the features and improvements
        you've added.
